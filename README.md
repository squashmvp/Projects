This is my projects folder. So far it only includes SVGs.

SVGs are pictures/visual graphics/images coded in HTML? Right?

I feel theres an infinite amount of artistic potential in SVGs, specifically in the unlimited scalability of the images and
the ease of customization. An example(to me) of artistic SVG implementation includes using CSS to produce a different
SVG image depending on the scale of the window. (Perhaps by switching the y and the x for every coordinate in a square 
SVG image to rotate the image for a landscape view?) A simpler example is using CSS to chang the color of an element in your SVG anytime
someone interacts with the image by clicking on it.

You load these images by opening them up in a browser. You can click and drag them into your browser. You can "Open With" your browser.
Super simple. I love it.

I do not recommend just going ahead and opening these files because I said so. I'm someone who has no capacity for malware or virus 
development but that still should not allow you to drop your guard. Take some time to do some research on the files and even 
the file formats. Learn about the website, though this website is too legit for those shenanigans from what I've seen. 
Learn about what you are downloading and the steps you can take to protect yourself and your hentai. 

Thanks for reading this. I hope you have a swell day!
