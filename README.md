This is my projects folder. So far it only includes SVGs.

SVGs are pictures/visual graphics/images coded in HTML? Right?

I feel theres an infinite amount of artistic potential in SVGs. So, I simply must explore them.

You load these images by opening them up in a browser. You can click and drag them into your browser. You can "Open With" your browser.
Super simple. I love it.

TO EDIT SVG(CSS or Programming knowledge required): 

COLOR-
  You can open any of these up in notepad or similar text editors. The second to last line in each SVG has a style statement.
  You can add any amount of CSS you would like here. To simply change the color of the arrow, replace the information between 
  the colon and the semicolon after "fill" with any of these:

    An rgb value: rgb(0, 0, 0)
    A hex value: #FFFFFF
    An hsl value: hsl(0, 0, 0)
    The word of a color: Blue

The coordinates are a little difficult to understand. If you have an easy time visualizing upside-down 2D line graphs, 
then you are in luck! Continue on. You have the X and you have the Y. These are coordinates for points on a graph. Right? You
have a point at (2, 3). Whats the X? 2. Whats the Y? 3. Thats the order. Never changes. Whats the X and Y in (The Brunette, The Blonde)?

Every 2 numbers makes a point on a graph in these SVGs. The viewbox is the size of the graph. In "arrow_down.svg" if you open it up in a
text editor like notepad(which btw you can do with every program ever), you will find the viewbox in line 1. The "<path..." is the actual image and its
points on the graph. Arrow down starts at (275, 10). L defines a line and up to what point that line should go. Line 5 in this script creates
a line that travels from point (275, 10) to (175, 10). A pen starts at (275, 10) and goes left for a little bit. Notice that capital letters are being used
in all instances. Capital letters define the absolute point. That is all I will say about it. Curves(C) are hard to understand but they are
fun to mess around with once understood (just remember the last two numbers in C statements are the ending point coordinates of the curve).
Compare the different direction arrow svgs coordinates between each other if you want to understand the graph a bit better.  
SVG is more than all of this but I hope this helps to get someones foot in the massive castle gates that is SVGs door. 

I do not recommend just going ahead and opening these files because I said so. I'm someone who has no capacity for malware or virus 
development but that still should not allow you to drop your guard. Take some time to do some research on the files and even 
the file formats. Learn about the website, though this website is too legit for those shenanigans from what I've seen. 
Learn about what you are downloading and the steps you can take to protect yourself and your hentai. 

Thanks for reading this. I hope you have a swell day!
